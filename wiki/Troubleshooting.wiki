  * No lights come on – Are you using an appropriate FTDI cable that supplies power?

  * The blue GPS light does not come on – Is the adapter board properly seated on the Ublox module (notoriously bad connector)?  Are you indoors where satellite signals may be too weak? Are you using the uBlox GPS module, or if not have you changed the configuration for the one you are using?
