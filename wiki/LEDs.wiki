When AIRSTART = 0, the red, blue and yellow LEDs will flash while the IMU is calibrating at startup. 

ArduIMU Indicator LEDs (after startup):

  * Green LED = Power On
  * Yellow LED = Indicates that the speed filter is supressing yaw drift correction. You should see it on if you are not in motion above the set threshold speed.
  * Red LED = Saturated Sensors
  * Blue LED = GPS, as follows:
   * Blue light off: GPS is not connected, is not sending messages, the wrong baud rate or protocol has been selected.
   * Blue light blinking: Valid messages are being received but no GPS lock yet. Blink rate is close to 1/2 the Hz of the GPS messages. Any messages sent faster than 8Hz will have a possibly negative effect on the parsing routines. Chances are good they will overflow the input buffers and more messages will be lost because of it.
   * Blue light solid: GPS Lock. Note: the blue LED will go out if the GPS signal is lost for 1/2 sec or more.
