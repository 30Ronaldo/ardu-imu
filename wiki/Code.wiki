== Loading the code ==

The board comes with the firmware pre-loaded, so you don't have to do anything. If, however, you want to upgrade to the latest firmware, do the following:

1) First, download the latest code from the [http://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/downloads/list repository].

2) Make any configuration changes needed. If you just want to try out the IMU with the desktop demo programs, make sure the following configuration options are set as shown:

{{{
#define PRINT_ANALOGS 1 //Will print the analog raw data
#define PRINT_EULER 1   //Will print the Euler angles Roll, Pitch and Yaw
#define PRINT_GPS 1     //Will print GPS data

#define PRINT_BINARY 0   //Will print binary message and suppress ASCII messages (above)
}}}

If you want to use ArduIMU with !ArduPilot, set the following configuration option as shown:

{{{
#define PRINT_BINARY 1   //Will print binary message and suppress ASCII messages (above)
}}}

3) Then you need to download Arduino if you don't already have it and use it to load the code on to the board with your FTDI cable. Just follow the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot/wiki/LoadingPage instructions] for !ArduPilot, replacing the !ArduPilot mentions with ArduIMU.
