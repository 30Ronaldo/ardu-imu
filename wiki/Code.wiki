== Loading the code ==

First, download the latest code from the [http://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/downloads/list repository].

Then you need to download Arduino if you don't already have it and use it to load the code on to the board with your FTDI cable. Just follow the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot/wiki/LoadingPage instructions] for ArduPilot, replacing the ArduPilot mentions with ArduIMU.
