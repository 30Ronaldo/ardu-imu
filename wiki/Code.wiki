== Loading the code ==

ArduIMU+ comes with some basic test firmware loaded at the factory, but to get full functionality you should load the latest AHRS firmware. Here's how:

*1)* First, download the latest code from the [http://code.google.com/p/ardu-imu/downloads/list repository].

*2)* Then you need to [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software download Arduino] if you don't already have it and install it. The instructions for loading !ArduIMU code are essentialy the same as for !ArduPilot, so follow them [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot/wiki/LoadingPage here] (especially the part about setting the "Set RTS on close" box and choosing the right board in the Arduino IDE) and then come back to this page.

*3)* Open Arduino and load the ArduIMU code from your ArduIMU code folder by open the "arduimu.pde" file, which will open all the tabs. Make any configuration changes needed in the first tab of the code. If you just want to try out the IMU with the desktop demo programs, make sure the following configuration options are set as shown:

{{{
#define PRINT_ANALOGS 1 //Will print the analog raw data
#define PRINT_EULER 1   //Will print the Euler angles Roll, Pitch and Yaw
#define PRINT_GPS 1     //Will print GPS data

#define PRINT_BINARY 0   //Will print binary message and suppress ASCII messages (above)
}}}

If you want to use ArduIMU with !ArduPilot, set the following configuration option as shown:

{{{
#define PRINT_BINARY 1   //Will print binary message and suppress ASCII messages (above)
}}}

*4)* Then connect the FTDI cable to connector pins you soldered on the ArduIMU (check on the bottom of the board where it shows which orientation to plug the FTDI cable in--black is on one side) and use it to load the code on to the board. Just follow the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot/wiki/LoadingPage instructions] for !ArduPilot, replacing the !ArduPilot mentions with ArduIMU.
