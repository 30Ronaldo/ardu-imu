*Introduction*

This is the ArduIMU+ Manual. Just follow the navigation links in the sidebar at left. As with all wikis, it's always a work in progress, and is constantly improving. If you have any comments you can make them at the bottom of each page. 

If you would like to contribute to building the manual, please send a message to [http://diydrones.com/profile/zlitezlite Chris Anderson] at DIY Drones and we'll give you access.
